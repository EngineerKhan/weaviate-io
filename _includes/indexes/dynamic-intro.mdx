A [dynamic index](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#dynamic-index) offers a flexible approach to indexing. A dynamic index begins as a flat index, and converts automatically to an HNSW index when a [collection](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#collections) or [tenant](/developers/weaviate/concepts/data#multi-tenancy) reaches a threshold size.
