HNSW indexes build a multi-layered object graph. The graph structure and HNSW algorithm result in efficient, approximate nearest neighbor [(ANN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) searches.

The index and graph structure are stored in RAM memory. The vectors are also stored in RAM. This makes HNSW indexes fast, but RAM is an expensive resource. Consider using [compression](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/managing-resources/compression) to reduce the size of for your HNSW indexes.
