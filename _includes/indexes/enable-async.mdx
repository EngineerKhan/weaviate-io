To enable asynchronous indexing, set the `ASYNC_INDEXING` parameter to `true` in your Weaviate configuration.

- [Docker Compose](developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose): Add `ASYNC_INDEXING` to `docker-compose.yml`.
- [Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes): Add `ASYNC_INDEXING` to `values.yaml`.

When enabled, asynchronous indexing is available for all of the collections in your Weaviate instance.
