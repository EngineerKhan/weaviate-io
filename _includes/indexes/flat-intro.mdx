[Flat indexes](/developers/weaviate/concepts/indexing/flat-indexes) are disk based. Compared to HNSW indexes, flat indexes have very small RAM requirements.

Flat indexes do brute-force vector searches. The search latency increases linearly with the number of objects. For that reason, flat indexes work best with small collections, less than 10,000 objects. If you expect the object count to grow significantly, consider using a [dynamic index](#dynamic-indexes).
