[Flat indexes](/developers/weaviate/concepts/indexing/flat-indexes) are memory-efficient. Flat indexes are disk based, rather than loaded into RAM.

Flat indexes do brute-force vector searches. The search latency increases linearly with the number of objects. For that reason, flat indexes work best with small collections, less than 10,000 objects.
