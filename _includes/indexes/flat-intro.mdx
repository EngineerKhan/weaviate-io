[Flat indexes](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#flat-index) are memory-efficient. They are disk based indexes that perform brute-force vector searches. Flat indexes work best with small collections, less than 10,000 objects. Vector search times increase linearly with the number of objects.
