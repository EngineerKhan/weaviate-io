<DynamicAsyncRequirements/>

The flat index is ideal for use cases with a small object count and provides lower memory overhead and good latency. As the object count increases the HNSW index provides a more viable solution as HNSW speeds up search. The goal of the dynamic index is to shorten latencies during querying time at the cost of a larger memory footprint as you scale.

By configuring a dynamic index, you can automatically switch from flat to HNSW indexes. This switch occurs when the object count exceeds a prespecified threshold (by default 10,000). This functionality only works with async indexing enabled. When the threshold is hit while importing, all the data piles up in the async queue, the HNSW index is constructed in the background and when ready the swap from flat to HNSW is completed.

Currently, this is only a one-way upgrade from a flat to an HNSW index, it does not support changing back to a flat index even if the object count goes below the threshold due to deletion.

This is particularly useful in a multi-tenant setup where building an HNSW index per tenant would introduce extra overhead. With a dynamic index, as individual tenants grow their index will switch from flat to HNSW, while smaller tenants' indexes remain flat.
