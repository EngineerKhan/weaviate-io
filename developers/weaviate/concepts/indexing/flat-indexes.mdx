[Binary quantization (BQ)](/developers/weaviate/configuration/compression/bq-compression) can improve flat indexes' search speeds. BQ improves search time by reducing the amount of data to read, and speeding up time taken to calculate the distance between vectors.

To configure a flat index, see: [Configure flat indexes](/developers/weaviate/configuration/indexing-vector/flat-indexes).
